Debian TODO for MBSE BBS
-------------------------

Packaging
----------
- Create man pages for executables;  for instance, using help2man.
- Create an mbsebbs-dbg package?   (Check references.)
- Create debian/README.Source file.
- Update debian/watch to correctly find new versions.
- Still need to get the scripts from scripts dir installed, 
with the mbse root variable replaced with /opt/mbse.  sed?
Perhaps after install to debian/mbsebbs/opt/mbse/bin/adm ?
(which still needs to be created if I'm going to use it.)

Configuration:
- Create & use debian/po, so that any debconf messages can be translated?
