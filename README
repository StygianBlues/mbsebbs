				MBSE BBS Packages.


Distribution naming scheme:

mbsebbs-0.33.18.tar.bz2
  |     | |  |
  |     | |  +-------- minor patchlevel 
  |     | +----------- minor version
  |     +------------- major version
  +------------------- package name

For fidonet distribution, the tar archive and FILE_ID.DIZ are
zipped together in a file like mbb03318.zip

The odd minor version numbers are developent versions only. From 0.35.1 and up
these will not be released anymore but are only available via cvs.

The even minor version numbers will be stable releases, they will be available
at http://www.mbse.eu and at 2:280/2802. The first version using this
scheme is 0.36.00

For first time installing, see the file INSTALL. After installation, the html
guide is installed in /opt/mbse/html.


Since 1 August 2013 I (Michiel Broek) stopped developing this package. But this
is a GPL2 licensed open source package so feel free to continue to improve it.
I only ask to make it clear to others that it is a modified package. You can do 
that by changing the version numbers and messages in the file configure.ac and
then run autoconf to update the configure scripts.
