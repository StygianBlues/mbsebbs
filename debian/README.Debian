mbsebbs for Debian
------------------

   If you get an error message such as this when mbtask is started: 
IBC: no fido udp entry in /etc/services, cannot start Internet BBS Chat
   That indicates that the entry for it is missing from the file.  Add
   a line such this to the /etc/services file:
fido		60179/udp			# MBSE BBS Chatserver
