-----------------------


    from lintian check of test build for 0.92.0+111209-1~1

W: mbsebbs source: debian-rules-missing-recommended-target build-arch
W: mbsebbs source: debian-rules-missing-recommended-target build-inde

E: mbsebbs: dir-or-file-in-opt (74! I think these are the ones that are no longer overridable) 

W: mbsebbs: package-contains-vcs-control-file usr/share/doc/mbsebbs/html/.cvsignore
E: mbsebbs: init.d-script-missing-dependency-on-remote_fs etc/init.d/mbsebbs: required-start

N: 32 tags overridden (32 info)
N: Some overrides were ignored, since the tags were marked "non-overridable".

- Create a debian/create-orig-source script
    1)  Create an orig archive from a mercurial export from the authors
        repository.  
    a) just the tip?
    b) a specific changeset

    2)  Create an orig archive from a release archive, downloaded.

Packaging
----------
- Change the installation directory to /usr/lib/mbsebbs
- Change the user name from mbse to mbsebbs?  

-    Add note to readme.debian regarding manually setting password for bbs user
 to "bbs".  Same for system user mbsebbs 

-    Add example(s) for mbbs nginx config?

- Reference line 53 in debian/rules;  only run the 'Make distclean' if the
  Makefile.global file is actually present.  Try something like this:
 if test -e Makefile.global; then $(MAKE) distclean; fi


- configure is not being rerun automatically.  In debian/rules clean target,
  remove the config.guess etc files so that it will be rerun automatically?
  Or does the make distclean take care of that when run?

- Configure script explicitly tests for programs only needed by run time system,
  so create patches to configure script that says that the programs are present.
  Will that need a build-depends for those programs? Or can just use Suggests?

- Create man pages for executables;  for instance, using help2man or html2man?.
  Or create basic man pages that points to the html documentation?

- With purge; remove user:group mbsebbs:bbs.  Remove /opt/mbsebbs directory.
- With at least purge, if not also remove:  remove statoverrides

- Add creation of a mbsebbs-dbg package (ref http://wiki.debian.org/DebugPackage)

- Create & use debian/po, so that any debconf messages can be translated?

  
Configuration:
- Run mbsetup as part of postinst for a new installation?  Or just advise that it should
  be run asap after a new install?  (Perhaps put a note about it in debian/News?)

- Add note about needing an FTN Nodelist

- Add a note about configuring html Docs root (1.15), URL Name, Author
name. perhaps a note about the 'Hist. Limit'
Example docs root => /opt/mbsebbs/var/www
- Create an example stats index file.
- will need to add a note about updating the config for that?

- Add a note, with details and/or pointing to example files, for configuring a web server.
(don't think it's already in the documentation?)
