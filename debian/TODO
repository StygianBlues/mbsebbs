Debian TODO for MBSE BBS
-------------------------

Packaging
----------
- With purge; remove user:group mbse:bbs.  Remove /opt/mbse directory.
- With at least purge, if not also remove:  remove statoverrides

- Create a basic man page that points to the html documentation?

- Create man pages for executables;  for instance, using help2man or html2man?.

- The README and README.Ubuntu files from the source archive do not need
  to be installed with the MBSE BBS package.

- Reference line 53 in debian/rules;  only run the 'Make distclean' if the
  Makefile.global file is actually present.
- configure is not being rerun automatically.  In debian/rules clean target,
  remove the config.guess etc files so that it will be rerun automatically?
  Or does the make distclean take care of that when run?

- Configure script explicitly tests for programs only needed by run time system,
  so create patches to configure script that says that the programs are present.
  Will that need a build-depends for those programs? Or can just use Suggests?

- Changing things like the default installation directory from /opt/mbse to
  /opt/mbsebbs, or the user from mbse to mbsebbs, requires changes to the 
  configure.ac file.  Like for the item above, that can be done using the patch
  system.

- Now using dh_lintian to install the package lintian overrides file. If need
  source package Lintian overrides, create debian/source.lintian-overrides.

- Create an mbsebbs-dbg package?   (Check references.)

- Create & use debian/po, so that any debconf messages can be translated?


Configuration:
- Run mbsetup as part of postinst for a new installation?  Or just advise that it should
  be run asap after a new install?  (Perhaps put a note about it in debian/News?)

- Add a note about configuring html Docs root (1.15), URL Name, Author
  name. perhaps a note about the 'Hist. Limit'
  Example docs root => /opt/mbse/var/www

- Create an example stats index file.
- will need to add a note about updating the config for that?

- Add a note, with details and/or pointing to example files, for configuring a
  web server. (don't think it's already in the documentation?)
