Debian TODO for MBSE BBS
-------------------------

Packaging
----------
- The /opt/mbse dirs are being installed with root ownership instead of mbse:bbs
- mbtask should be root:root, not root:bbs
- With purge; remove user:group mbse:bbs?  Remove /opt/mbse directory?
- With at least purge, if not also remove:  remove statoverrides
- The English Text, macro, & menu files are being installed automatically during 
  the initial installation;  need to install the others.
- configure is not being rerun automatically.  In debian/rules clean target,
  remove the config.guess etc files so that it will be rerun automatically?
- Create man pages for executables;  for instance, using help2man.
- Create an mbsebbs-dbg package?   (Check references.)
- Create & use debian/po, so that any debconf messages can be translated?
- Configure script explicitly tests for programs only needed by run time system.

Configuration:
-  Run mbsetup as part of postinst for a new installation?
