		with names longer than 8 characters.

		3.  Updated copyright notices to 2019.

v1.0.7.11B      22-Jan-2019 - Vincent Coen

		1.  This patch a simply adds /usr/pkg/include and /usr/pkg/lib to the
		configure.ac file, enabling the proper detection of libGeoIP and libbz2
		on NetBSD systems. The reason for this change is that for a time now,
		NetBSD uses /usr/pkg as the path for all libraries, binaries and other
		content installed through the pkg_add command or the pkgsrc installation
		tree. That way the keep the files and programs provided by the core
		system separated from user installed packages.

		2.  Update CP to 2019.
