        MBSE BBS Packages.


Distribution naming scheme:

mbsebbs-1.0.6.tar.bz2
  |     | | |
  |     | | +--------- minor patchlevel
  |     | +----------- minor version
  |     +------------- major version
  +------------------- package name

For fidonet distribution, the tar archive and FILE_ID.DIZ are
zipped together in a file like MBSE-106.ZIP

For first time installing, see the file INSTALL. After a manual installation,
the html guide is installed in /opt/mbse/html.


Since 1 August 2013 I (Michiel Broek) stopped developing this package. But this
is a GPL2 licensed open source package so feel free to continue to improve it.
I only ask to make it clear to others that it is a modified package. You can do
that by changing the version numbers and messages in the file configure.ac and
then run autoconf to update the configure scripts.
