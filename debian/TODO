Debian TODO for mbsebbs
-----------------------

- Add example(s) for mbsebbs nginx config?

- Rewrite debian/copyright for DEP 5. Review code again; there are at least
  some files that are not by the MBSE BBS author that are included in the
  code and will need to be listed.

- Configure script explicitly tests for programs only needed by run time system,
  so create patches to configure script that says that the programs are present.
  Will that need a build-depends for those programs? Or can just use Suggests?

- Should what I'm installing to doc/mbsebbs/examples be installed somewhere
  in /usr/share/mbsebbs instead?  Or, along with? Checked and it's not unusual
  to have a /usr/share/package/examples directory.

- Create man pages for executables;  for instance, using help2man or html2man?.
  Or create basic man pages that points to the html documentation?

- Add creation of a mbsebbs-dbg package (ref http://wiki.debian.org/DebugPackage)

- Create & use debian/po, so that any debconf messages can be translated?

- Add a note about configuring html Docs root (1.15), URL Name, Author name.
  A note about the 'Hist. Limit'? Example docs root = /opt/mbsebbs/var/www?
- Create an example stats index file.
- will need to add a note about updating the config for that?

- Add a note, with details and/or pointing to example files, for configuring a web server.
 (don't think it's already in the documentation?)
