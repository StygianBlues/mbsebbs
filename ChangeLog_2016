v1.0.6.9	28-Sep-2016 - Andrew Leary

		1.  Fixed compiler warnings while building the BBS.  Thanks to
		Ken Bowley for the patches.

		2.  Fixed a bug with the use of an external editor, and removed
		a limitation that forced a message to have at least two lines.
		Thanks to Ken Bowley for these patches as well.

v1.0.6.8	20-Jul-2016 - Andrew Leary

		1.  Fixed the SETUP.sh script to handle installing on fresh
		installations of Ubuntu 12.04+.  These versions do not install
		an admin group, which MBSE uses to enable the mbse user to run
		sudo.  SETUP.sh will now add the admin group if it doesn't
		exist, to prevent useradd failing to create the mbse user.
		This change only affects first time installations on Ubuntu
		12.04 or later.

v1.0.6.7	28-Jun-2016 - Andrew Leary

		1.  Added the ability to disable cross-zone SEEN-BY
		stripping to mbfido.  This is currently a global toggle,
		defaulting to strip SEEN-BYs when crossing zone boundaries. 
		In situations where this behavior is not desired, toggle the
		SBstrip option to "No" in mbsetup 1.11.20.  If there is
		enough call for it, I will consider making this configurable
		on a group and/or area basis.

v1.0.6.6	23-Jun-2016 - Andrew Leary

		1.  Several spelling and grammar corrections in mbsebbs.c,
		chat.c, offline.c, and newuser.c.  Thanks to Sean Dennis for
		the updates.

v1.0.6.5	12-Feb-2016 - Robert James Clay

		1. Edit README file to better reflect current practice.
