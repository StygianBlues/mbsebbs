		combinations of OS and architecture.

v1.0.7.10	28-Sep-2018 - Andrew Leary

		1.  Updated the configuration file for using joe as the BBS
		external editor to support current versions of joe.  joe 4.2
		is now the minimum version supported; all releases up to and
		including 4.6 have been tested and found to work.  Thanks to
		Deon George for the patch.

		2.  When creating a new Services database, mbsetup will now
		include AreaFix and FileFix as known services, for the Areamgr
		and Filemgr services respectively.  Also fixed a bug that
		caused the wrong number of records to be returned when creating
		a new Services database.

		3.  Updated the Makefiles to install most of the BBS binaries
		as read & execute only.  Thanks to Deon George for the patch.

		4.  Added $DESTDIR support to the Makefiles, to make it easier
		to build .DEB packages.  This change should be transparent to
		users building and installing MBSE.  Thanks to Deon George for
		the patch.

v1.0.7.9	17-Sep-2018 - Andrew Leary

		1.  Removed the requirement that incoming .TIC files have
		exactly 8 character filenames with the .TIC extension.  This

		a DOS compatible 8 character filename, a dot, and the 3
		character extension TIC.
