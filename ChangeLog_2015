v1.0.6.4	22-Nov-2015 - Andrew Leary

		1. Updated mbfido's .tic file support to use "Lfile" instead
		of "Fullname" when creating .tic files.  This is to increase
		compatibility with HTick, and comply with the recently
		released FSP-1039.  Both keywords will be accepted in
		incoming .tic files.

v1.0.6.3	05-Nov-2015 - Robert James Clay

		1. Update the Dev Team information in the AUTHORS file.

		03-Nov-2015 - Vincent Coen

		1. Add mbse-1.odt to the docs directory.

v1.0.6.2	17-Oct-2015 - Vincent Coen

		1. Amended mbmon.c and mbsetup.c to reflect new hosting
		for the sources etc at www.sourceforge.net.
		2. Other very minor cosmetics.
		3. Add mbse-1.pdf to a new docs directory.

v1.0.6.1	07-Aug-2015 - Andrew Leary

		1.  Removed the Precise field from Via lines in netmail, as
		it was not actually accurate anyway.  Forwarded netmails had
		this field set to .00, and locally generated netmails had this
		field set to .01.  This field is optional in FTS-4009, but
		if used is supposed to indicate fractions of a second.

v1.0.6		03-Aug-2015 - Andrew Leary

		1.  Added support for specifying a literal IPv6 address
		encased in square brackets for a node.  Previously, IPv6 was
		only supported for nodes having an AAAA record for their
		hostname in DNS.
		2.  The BBS now allows alphanumeric and punctuation
		characters in user passwords.  Previously, only alphanumeric
		characters were permitted.  
		3.  Several minor grammar and punctuation corrections.
