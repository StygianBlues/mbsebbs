v0.92.0		08-Oct-2006 - 16-Oct-2007

	general:
                With this version de default internal character encoding is
                UTF-8. BBS users who have a UTF-8 terminal can use the bbs in
                UTF-8 mode and should have no troubles at all reading and
                writing messages in several language encodings.
		Fixed building on FreeBSD, tested on 5.3 and 6.2.
		Added support to link to the GeoIP library. If it's present on
		your system, mbcico, mbsebbs, mbnewusr and mbnntp will log the
		country from which the connection is made.
                Added example telnet login for NetBSD.
                Dropped support for NetBSD < 3.0.
                Added support for Ubuntu.
		Added support for the ARM processor.

	upgrade:
                Because some directories will be moved, a special upgrade
                procedure is needed. Take the following steps:
                1. Don't install the new source yet and make a backup!
                2. In the source topdir run "make clean".
                3. Unpack the new source.
                4. Build new source, "./configure" and "make".
                5. Run "./mbsetup-0.92.0/mbsetup", enter global setup and
                   leave with save. this 'should' move all your existing
                   language files to the new directory structure.
                6. "su", run "make install" and restart the bbs.
                7. "exit".
                If you didn't do steps 1 and 2 (automatic updates) and you
                installed the source over the old source, you will have some
                extra files in the lang subdir of the source. No big deal.
                If you didn't run step 5 then the new language paths have
                the default files from source and not your own. Your own files
                are then still under ~/english/*.* ~/dutch/*.* etc. Move the
                contents of these subdirs into ~/share/int/menus/en/* etc.
                Compile and install this new version.
                In all macro files html.* change the charset to UTF-8. You will
		find these in /opt/mbse/share/int/macro/*/html.*
                If you still have all default macro files then in the source
                directory mbsebbs/examples simply run "make macros" to install
                the updated versions.
                Run "mbfile index -f " once to regenerate all download html
                index pages with UTF-8 encoding. Check the error.log for
                errors.
                In mbsetup menu 1.3.7 change logo.asc into logo.ans and make
                sure you have that file. A note about the logo file, it will
                be displayed before we know if a user has a utf-8 or ansi
                terminal, so change your logo screen so that it has no ansi
                grafic characters, just plain ascii with ansi color codes.
                Start and leave mbsetup, this will upgrade the newfiles and
                filefind reports to set a defaults CHRS kludge CP437 2 which
                is good for reports with ANSI blockgraphics.
 		The next step is optional but advised to make the symbolic
		links in the download areas without path information:               

                mbse$ cd /opt/mbse/ftp
                mbse$ find pub -type l -exec rm '{}' \;
                mbse$ mbfile check

                Make sure mbtask is restarted.

                In rfc2ftn if we cannot find the incoming charset from the
                standard table we will fall back to the charset in the
                Content-type: header and try to initialize iconv with that
                value.
                For debug info help to me, the headers Content-Type and
                Content-Transfer-Encoding are temporary stored in the fido
                message as kludges.

                Now also creates allfiles.utf and newfiles.utf with UTF-8
                encoded text. These new files will also be added to the zip
                archives.
