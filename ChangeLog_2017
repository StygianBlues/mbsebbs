v1.0.7.4	26-Aug-2017 - Andrew Leary

		1.  Updated to FTSCPROD.019 as released by the FTSC.

		2.  When creating a new ~/etc/domain.data, mbsetup no longer
		includes entries for FidoNet zones 5 & 6.

		3.  Began preliminary work on FTN domain aliases, similar to
		the BinkD "domain <new-name> alias-for <name>" option.  This
		will allow MBSE to fully communicate with systems that use
		FTN domain names longer than 8 characters, which are NOT
		FTSC compliant.

		1.  Updated to FTSCPROD.018 as released by the FTSC.

v1.0.6.14	28-Jan-2017 - Andrew Leary

		1.  Changed the storage format for the last OLR download
		date to ensure that the users.data would remain portable

		grammar and spelling issues.  Thanks to Sean Dennis for this
		update.
