Debian TODO for MBSE BBS
-------------------------

Packaging
----------

- Change patching system from dpatch to quilt, as a step in changing from a
  format 1.0 package to a format 3.0 package.

- Reference line 53 in debian/rules;  only run the 'Make distclean' if the
  Makefile.global file is actually present.
- configure is not being rerun automatically.  In debian/rules clean target,
  remove the config.guess etc files so that it will be rerun automatically?
  Or does the make distclean take care of that when run?

- Configure script explicitly tests for programs only needed by run time system,
  so create patches to configure script that says that the programs are present.
  Will that need a build-depends for those programs? Or can just use Suggests?

- Create man pages for executables;  for instance, using help2man or html2man?.
  Or create basic man pages that points to the html documentation?

- With purge; remove user:group mbse:bbs.  Remove /opt/mbse directory.
- With at least purge, if not also remove:  remove statoverrides

- Now using dh_lintian to install the package lintian overrides file. If need
  source package Lintian overrides, create debian/source.lintian-overrides.

- Create an mbsebbs-dbg package?   (Check references.)

- Create & use debian/po, so that any debconf messages can be translated?

  
Configuration:
- Run mbsetup as part of postinst for a new installation?  Or just advise that it should
  be run asap after a new install?  (Perhaps put a note about it in debian/News?)

- example logrotate.d file
- Create a debian/mbsebbs.logrotate file, so that dh_installlogrotate can install
  it?  And/or also provide an example file?  Or just a note in the debian readme?

- Add note about needing an FTN Nodelist

- Add a note about configuring html Docs root (1.15), URL Name, Author
name. perhaps a note about the 'Hist. Limit'
Example docs root => /opt/mbse/var/www
- Create an example stats index file.

- Add a note, with details and/or pointing to example files, for configuring a web server.
(don't think it's already in the documentation?)

- Add a note about configuring html Docs root (1.15), URL Name, Author
name. perhaps a note about the 'Hist. Limit'
Example docs root => /opt/mbse/var/www
- will need to add a note about updating the config for that?
