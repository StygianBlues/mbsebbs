Debian TODO for MBSE BBS
-------------------------

Packaging
----------
- Configure user:group mbse:bbs -  in preinst/postinst script?
- Set environmental variable $MBSE_ROOT;  required for program execution.
- crontab:  Once have user:group mbse:bbs being configured, install a             
crontab for mbsebbs under that user (in postinst)?.  Or ask a question
about installing it?
- configure is not being rerun automatically.  In debian/rules clean target,
remove the config.guess etc files so that it will be rerun automatically?
- Add "joe" to debian/control recommends or suggests?
- Add "sshd" to debian/control recommends or suggests?
- Add "telnetd-ssl | telnetd" to debian/control recommends or suggests?
- Create man pages for executables;  for instance, using help2man.
- Create an mbsebbs-dbg package?   (Check references.)
- Create debian/README.Source file.
- Update debian/watch to correctly find new versions.
- Create & use debian/po, so that any debconf messages can be translated?
- Configure /etc/services for Internet BBS Chat service.
- Configure script explicitly tests for programs only needed by run time system.

Configuration:
-  Run mbset up as part of postinst for a new installation?
